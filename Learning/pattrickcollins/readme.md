### 1st Feb:
#### Learned what blockchain is, it is pinky swear, promises to keep data or any other thing bound to it as it is expected. done till 30.41mins

### 4th Feb
#### created metamask wallet and add sepolia test net to it added test coins through sepolia faucet - 1:05:31

#### How does blockchain work:
    SHA 256 mechanism hota for hashing, etherium use keckak256, humara message and block number hash ho ja hai and ek hash number create hota hai. Actual BC mai 3 component hote hai 
    1. Block Number
    2. Nonce
    3. Message
    to apne ko nonce calculate karna hai which starts with 4 zeros`s for the given block number and message, so for that nonce we get a hash that becomes hash for that. Now distributed kyu bolete hai ? sabke pass local mai BC hai, agar maine change kiya to aage ki sari invalidate ho jayegi, magar agar maine mine bhi kar liya vapis, doosro se jab poochege ki bhai tera hash kya hai to hum logo ka match nahi karega and as a result sab ka same hoga and not me and mujhe hata diya jayega. Hum log apni private key use karte hai koi bhi transction ko sign karne ke liye, and usse transction key generate hoti hai and "eliptical curve digital signature" yeh mechanism use hota hai for creating signature. 
    Humari public key se jo humara signature hai voh pata kar sakte hai  ki humara hai , to koi aur bole nahi sakta ki yeh transction uska hai
    address kaise derive hota hai: apni public key ko lo and then hshing mechnism mai dalo and last 25 letters. hashin mechnism can change from BC to BC
